README
------

This is Tk::Splash, a perl/Tk module for creating splash screens.
There is nothing special about Tk::Splash, as it is only here for
compatibility issues. However, the companion module, Tk::SafeSplash,
uses some internal perl/Tk magic to create the splash screen very
fast.

Tk::Splash should work with older (402.*) and newer (800.*) Tk's.
Tk::SafeSplash will only work with newer Tk's (800.* and upwards), but
future compatibility cannot be assured :-)

Installation

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

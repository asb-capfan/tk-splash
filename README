README
------

This is Tk::Splash, a perl/Tk module for creating splash screens.
There is nothing special about Tk::Splash (it's just a toplevel with
an embedded issue), as it is only here for compatibility issues.
However, the companion module, Tk::FastSplash, uses some internal
perl/Tk magic to create the splash screen very fast.

Tk::Splash should work with older (402.*) and newer (800.*) Tk's.
Tk::FastSplash will only work with newer Tk's (800.* and upwards), but
future compatibility cannot be assured :-)

Tk::ProgressSplash is a splash window with a progress bar.

Installation
